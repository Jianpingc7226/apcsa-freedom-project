# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

### Progress
In the pasted few weeks, I and my partner had finished our beyond MVP, we added a like button and twisted a little on the style of our common feature. Also in the past few weeks, we had presented our project at our school EXPO and in our APCSA class.

### Take away

###### EXPO take away
We also presented our project at the EXPO, overall we did well in introducing our project, be there are still things we can improve, like making eye contact and cutting parts in our elevator pitch that is repeating not important concepts (we repeated the purpose twice).

###### Class presentation take away
The next week after the EXPO, I and my partner prepared a [presentation slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14K0Z19Bckk0g3RxvWIlAsd6SXktdLaj4Mmu0GlWTK4M/edit?usp=sharing) (video demo is included in the slide). Throughout the presentation, we did a great job of introducing and answering the question, but I wasn't making enough eye contact with the class and we didn't prepare a conclusion slide for the presentation, which is another important minus point.

### Engineering Design Process
Now I and my partner are on Step 8 of the Engineering Design Process, Communicating the results. Since we now are done with our beyond MVP, we are discussing what else we can improve or the bug we had encountered (Now the most obvious bug is that user network instability will affect data loading)

### Skills
The skills we used are Communication and Growth mindset, during the presentation and EXPO we received some advice on how can we improve our project, those advice are valuable.
