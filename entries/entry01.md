## Tool

 The tool I decided to use is **firebase**, and in this freedom project, I will be working with my partner Andy that had decided to use the tool **Android Studio**. We discussed what app we are going to make in android and after a long discussion, we decided that we want to make an app that works like a **forum** with a **Point System** where people can earn points from daily login or respond to a comment or post. You might as a question:

###### what is the cool thing about the point? What does it do?

 We end up deciding to let the user post a special post with some amount of point as a reward, for example, a student can post a question and use some of his points as the **reward** for the respondent. The student can choose the response that best answers his question and the point as a reward will be given away to the respondent that answers the question.

## Begin

 We created a Discord channel for us to communicate on the project, after discussing the concept of the android app, we started to search up on google about the tools we are using. I read through the [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0) and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRYnm_k3w1w) of setting up firebase on Android Studio, we downloaded the Android Studio and started to set up our project in GitHub ide. We face some trouble on pull and pushing between the GitHub repository and our project on android studio, but then we found out that one of the plug-in names git help us to connect our project to the Github repository.
