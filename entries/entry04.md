### Progress
During these few weeks me and my partner Andy are working together to find a way to fix all the bugs we had now on our MVP. We end up deciding to create another project and start over from begging, but then we faced another trouble - Android Studio had updated since the last time we used it, and now upper-lever(project level) build.Gradle looks different than the last version we worked on. I noticed that [the repository JCenter is now shutdown](https://blog.gradle.org/jcenter-shutdown) and no longer supporting Gradle in android studio, now android studio is using another repository called [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/) which is harder for me to reset up firebase on android studio. All the tutorials I had watched is published by firebase's youtube channel before the JCenter had shut down, which mean I had to discover another way to set up firebase for us to proceed.

I am missing buildScrpit and allproject in my project-level build.Gradle

### Engineering design process.
Not we are on the step of creating a prototype in the engineering design process, before I found out how to set up firebase on Android Studio without JCenter, my partner will work on the display of our project, then I will catch up to him once I found out a way to set up firebase. 

### Skills I used

The Skill we used is Google and Collaboration. I and my partner Andy often discuss the issue we encountered and share videos that we think will help each other in learning our tools.
