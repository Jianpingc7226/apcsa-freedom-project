# APCSA Freedom Project
by Jianping Chen

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about learning a tool outside of our class content and using it to design and develop our project. The purpose of this blog is to document all my learning processes and the problem I encountered during my learning.

## Content
For my project, I am making an Android Education Forum. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying firebase and android studio in order to make a mobile forum that allow students and educators to ask and answer questions.

## Implications
Our intention for creating this app is to provide students and teachers with more tools that will improve communication within school communities. Students and teachers alike can seek help on any questions they may have by posting them on our app or they can find answers to the comments made by others regarding the answer to their question. The social nature of this app is also not to be underestimated, students can meet other people outside their school. The app can also decrease the time students spent on tutoring when they can simply get helped from our forum instead of spending their time in tutoring. But overall this is not without shortcomings, students may be overly reliant on our app to solve the problem, which will student's grades in a negative way.
